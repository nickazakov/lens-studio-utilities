# Raindrops Shader
Feel free to use this shader in your projects. It was originally developed for [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldSBWW) by **@eliemichel**, but I've repurposed it to work with Lens Studio.
<br/>
Developed in **Lens Studio 4.49**

## How to use

Drag the **Raindrops.lsmat** file in the **Objects** panel.
<br/>
Attach it to a screen image or a mesh to see the effect!
